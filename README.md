The main aim of this project ‘MyHome’ app is enable automation in day-to-day activities and make it available to user easily. Artificial Intelligence has increasing applications in people’s lives. These applications are constantly evolving due to the high rate of technological advances being made. 

The app consists of two modules:

1.Use voice commands to control music player with commands like play, pause, next and previous:
  The SpeechRecognizer class of Android provides access to the speech recognition service. This service allows access to the speech recognizer. 
The implementation of this API is likely to stream audio to remote servers to perform speech recognition. As such this API is not intended to be used for continuous recognition, which would consume a significant amount of battery and bandwidth

2.Text detection module for detecting text from images accurately and searching on Google instantly:
Firebase ML Kit is used to recognize text in images. ML Kit has both a general-purpose API suitable for recognizing text in images, such as the text of a street sign, and an API optimized for recognizing the text of documents.
